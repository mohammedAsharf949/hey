I love you in all your moods and I understand them. But this time, I made a mistake. Please don't be mad at me. This time, I wasn't smart in what I did.

I really love you so much.I appreciate you always being by my side. You're my number one supporter, and I rely on you. I never want you to be away from me or take a break. I misjudged the situation, and I'm sorry for that. I understand my mistake.You are my first and last love. You are my beloved, my soul, my life, and my everything. may God keep you for me forever, my sweetie.";
